# mtg-ring-database-display
Checking out Spring MVC with the database of Magic The Gathering cards which was created through my JavaFX application from here:

https://github.com/dlrzz/mtgring-client

## How does it work?

The first view is taken from the Database of decks which I used for the game. Next, you can enter the specific deck and see the full list of cards inside. Finally, clicking on the particular card will display it on the same page inside the iframe on the right.

It was a small project, but I had a lot of fun making it!
